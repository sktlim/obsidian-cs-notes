### Process Creation
1) System Initialization
2) Execution of process-creation system call by running process: e.g. fork()
3) User request to create a new process
4) Initialization of batch job: mainly for batch systems where user submits batch jobs

### Process Termination
1) Normal exit (voluntary)
2) Error exit (voluntary): Exit gracefully
3) Fatal error (involuntary): illegal instruction, referencing non-existent memory, crash immediately
4) Killed by another process (involuntary)

### Process Hierarchy
- Unix processes belong to a single tree, with `init` at the root
	- Processes in Unix cannot disown their children
- Windows has no concept of process hierarchy
	- When process created, parent is given special token (called handle) that it can use to control child
	- handle can be passed to other processes, therefore invalidating any process hierarchy

### Process States
Possible state diagram might be
1. Running (actually using CPU)
2. Ready (runnable; temporarily stopped to let other process run)
3. Blocked (unable to run until some external event e.g. IO occurs)

### Process Implementation
- OS maintains a table called process table, with one entry per process (aka **process control blocks** (PCB))
- PCB contains everything that needs to be saved as a process transitions between process states

#### When interrupt occurs
1. **Hardware Stacks Program Counter and Other Critical Registers**
	- When interrupt occurs, the CPU stops current execution and saves the **program counter (PC)** and other critical registers (such as the **status register**) onto the **stack**.
	- The **program counter** contains the address of the next instruction to execute
	- Some systems also save other key registers like the accumulator or index registers, depending on the CPU architecture. This allows the CPU to preserve the current program's state before switching to handle the interrupt.

2. **Hardware Loads New Program Counter from Interrupt Vector**
	- The CPU then loads a new **program counter value** from a predefined location called the **interrupt vector table**.
	- The interrupt vector table is a specific memory region that stores addresses of interrupt service routines (ISRs) for each possible interrupt. Each interrupt type has an assigned address in this table.
	- By loading the new program counter value, the CPU jumps to the appropriate ISR, starting the execution of the code that will handle the interrupt
	
3. **Assembly Language (ASM) Procedure Saves Registers**
	- The ISR (often written in ASM for efficiency) begins by saving all the CPU registers (such as general-purpose registers and floating-point registers) onto the **stack** or another memory location.
	- This step ensures that the ISR can safely modify registers without affecting the state of the interrupted program.
	- Essential for ensuring **context integrity** so that, after the interrupt is handled, the CPU can restore the original state of the program and resume it seamlessly.
	
4. **Assembly Language Procedure Sets Up a New Stack**
	- The ISR typically switches to a **new stack** dedicated to handling the interrupt. This is particularly useful for systems that require isolation between user processes and the ISR, as the ISR needs its own stack space.
	- By setting up a new stack, the ISR avoids overwriting the stack of the interrupted program, which could lead to data corruption or unpredictable behavior.
	- The stack setup may involve loading a new **stack pointer** or setting a **stack frame** that the ISR will use for local variables and temporary storage.
	
5. **C Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) Runs (Reads and Buffers Input)**
	- Once the assembly setup is complete, control is handed over to a **C interrupt service routine** (or higher-level ISR code) that performs the actual interrupt handling logic.
	- This C ISR performs actions specific to the interrupt. For example, if the interrupt was triggered by a hardware device like a keyboard or network card, the ISR might **read input data** from the device and **buffer it** for later processing by the main program.
	- The ISR may also **acknowledge** the interrupt by sending a signal back to the hardware to indicate that the interrupt has been handled, allowing the device to resume normal operation.
	
6. **Scheduler Decides Next Program to Run**
	- After the ISR completes its main tasks, the **scheduler** (part of the operating system) is invoked to determine the next program or process to run.
	- The scheduler may decide to resume the interrupted process if there are no higher-priority tasks waiting, or it may select a different process if the system is multitasking or if a higher-priority process became ready during the interrupt.
	- The scheduling decision is based on factors like **priority levels**, **process states**, and **CPU time allotments**. If a different process is chosen, the system must perform a **context switch** to load that process's state.
	
7. **C Procedure Returns to Assembly Code**
	- After the C-level ISR completes and the scheduler has made its decision, control returns to the **assembly-level ISR**.
	- This C-to-assembly transition allows the low-level assembly code to handle the final steps of the interrupt handling process, such as restoring the saved CPU registers and preparing the CPU to resume execution of the selected process.
	- Returning to assembly gives the ISR more direct control over CPU registers, memory management, and stack handling, which are necessary to maintain system stability.
	
8. **Assembly Procedure Restores Registers and Starts Up New (or Original) Process**
	- The assembly ISR now **restores** all the previously saved CPU registers from the stack or memory, including the program counter, so the CPU can resume execution from where it left off.
	- If the scheduler decided to continue the interrupted program, the ISR restores the original program counter, effectively resuming the interrupted program.
	- If a context switch occurred, the program counter and other registers for the new process are loaded, and the CPU begins executing this new process instead.
	- After this final restoration, the interrupt handling is complete, and the CPU returns to normal operation, executing instructions for the next scheduled process.

### CPU Utilization
$$CPU \space Utilization = 1-p^n$$ where 
$p$ is fraction of time process spends waiting for IO to complete and 
$n$ is processes in memory at once
