## TL;DR
- **Mutex** is for controlling exclusive access to critical region
- **Semaphores** control access based on a limit
- **Condition Variables** are almost always used with a mutex and allow threads to wait for a condition/ state change

### Summary of Differences

| Feature               | Semaphore                              | Mutex                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Type**              | Can be counting or binary              | Binary                                |
| **Ownership**         | No strict ownership                    | Strict ownership (only the locking thread can unlock) |
| **Use Case**          | Resource counting, signaling, task synchronization | Mutual exclusion for critical sections |
| **Blocking Behavior** | Blocking until count > 0               | Blocking until unlocked               |
| **Busy-Waiting**      | Can be busy-wait or blocking           | Usually blocking (spinlocks are busy-waiting mutexes) |
| **Signaling**         | Yes, can signal other threads          | No, must be combined with condition variables for signaling |
| **Implementation**    | More complex due to counting, flexibility | Simpler, lower overhead               |

In summary, **semaphores** are more versatile for managing access to multiple instances of a resource or signaling between threads, while **mutexes** are more specialized and efficient for exclusive access to a single critical section, with strict ownership making them safer for enforcing mutual exclusion.

### 1. Type and Value

   - **Semaphore**:
     - A semaphore is a counter that can take values greater than 1 (in the case of counting semaphores) or can be binary (0 or 1, in binary semaphores).
     - It can be used to allow multiple threads access to a certain number of resources by setting the counter to the number of available resources.
     - Counting semaphores track multiple instances of a resource, while binary semaphores function similarly to mutexes, allowing only one thread access at a time.

   - **Mutex**:
     - A mutex is a binary lock that can only be in one of two states: locked (1) or unlocked (0).
     - It is designed to provide exclusive access to a single thread at a time, ensuring mutual exclusion in accessing a shared resource.

### 2. Ownership

   - **Semaphore**:
     - Semaphores do not enforce ownership. Any thread can perform `up` or `down` on the semaphore, meaning a thread that did not lock the semaphore can unlock it.
     - This lack of ownership makes semaphores more flexible but also more error-prone, as improper use can lead to inconsistent states if a thread signals (ups) a semaphore it didn’t originally lock.

   - **Mutex**:
     - Mutexes have strict ownership. Only the thread that locks (acquires) the mutex is allowed to unlock (release) it.
     - This enforcement prevents accidental unlocking by another thread, making mutexes a safer choice for protecting critical sections.

### 3. Primary Use Cases

   - **Semaphore**:
     - Semaphores are suitable for signaling and managing access to a limited pool of resources.
     - Counting semaphores are commonly used for scenarios where multiple resources are being managed (e.g., controlling access to a pool of database connections).
     - Binary semaphores are often used for signaling events, like in producer-consumer problems or to coordinate phases among multiple threads.

   - **Mutex**:
     - Mutexes are used strictly for mutual exclusion in protecting critical sections.
     - They are ideal for enforcing exclusive access to a resource by a single thread at any time, ensuring data consistency within critical sections of code.

### 4. Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Behavior

   - **Semaphore**:
     - When a semaphore's value is zero (in a binary semaphore) or its count reaches zero (in a counting semaphore), threads attempting to `down` (decrement) on it are blocked.
     - When a thread performs an `up` operation, one of the blocked threads is typically awakened, allowing it to proceed. The thread waking behavior can be managed (e.g., in priority order) but is often chosen arbitrarily.

   - **Mutex**:
     - When a thread tries to acquire a mutex that is already locked, it is blocked until the mutex becomes available.
     - Mutexes typically have options for recursive behavior (where a thread can lock a mutex it has already locked) and can sometimes support priority-based or fair scheduling.

### 5. Busy-Waiting and Spinlocks

   - **Semaphore**:
     - Semaphores can be implemented in a way that avoids busy-waiting by putting threads to sleep when they can’t proceed.
     - However, semaphores can also be implemented with busy-waiting in low-level contexts where threads may repeatedly check if a resource becomes available (spinlocks).

   - **Mutex**:
     - Some mutex implementations (e.g., spinlocks) may use busy-waiting, where a thread continually checks if the lock is available.
     - Standard mutex implementations avoid busy-waiting by blocking threads that try to acquire the mutex when it is unavailable, which is more efficient for long waiting times.

### 6. Signaling Capability

   - **Semaphore**:
     - Semaphores can be used as signaling mechanisms. A binary semaphore, for instance, can signal a waiting thread when a certain event has occurred, making semaphores useful for task synchronization.
     - The flexibility of `up` and `down` without strict ownership allows one thread to signal another thread, which is essential in producer-consumer problems.

   - **Mutex**:
     - Mutexes do not inherently provide signaling; they are purely for locking and unlocking a critical section.
     - If signaling is required, mutexes must be combined with condition variables or other synchronization primitives to coordinate between threads.

### 7. Implementation Complexity and Overhead

   - **Semaphore**:
     - Semaphores are generally more complex and may have higher overhead because they manage counters and require potentially more complicated scheduling of blocked threads.
     - Counting semaphores also require additional operations to track the count and release waiting threads correctly, making them slightly more resource-intensive than simple mutexes.

   - **Mutex**:
     - Mutexes are typically simpler and faster to implement, especially if only a binary state is needed.
     - Mutexes generally incur lower overhead, making them the preferred choice when exclusive access to a single resource is required without additional signaling or counting.
