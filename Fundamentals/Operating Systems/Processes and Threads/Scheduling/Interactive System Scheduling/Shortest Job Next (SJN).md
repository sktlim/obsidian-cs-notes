### How SJN Works in Interactive Systems

Interactive processes follow a pattern of waiting for and executing commands. By treating each command as a separate job, SPN minimizes response time by selecting the shortest command to run next. Since knowing the exact runtime of each command is difficult, **estimation techniques** based on past command runtimes are used to approximate the length of the next command.

1. **Estimating Process Length**: Each command’s runtime is estimated based on the process's past behavior. Suppose the estimated runtime for a command is $T_0$​, and the actual runtime measured next is $T_1$​. An updated estimate can be made using a weighted average, like $aT0+(1−a)T1$​, where the factor $a$ controls how quickly the estimate adapts to recent behavior. For example, with $a=1/2$, each new estimate weights recent runs more heavily, reducing the influence of older values through a process called **aging**.
    
2. **Aging**: Using $a=1/2$, aging is particularly simple to implement. The estimate is updated by averaging the previous estimate and the latest runtime, effectively by adding the two values and dividing by 2 (or, in binary systems, shifting right by one bit). Aging allows the estimate to adapt quickly to changes in runtime patterns without completely forgetting past behavior.
    

### Advantages of SPN with Aging in Interactive Systems
- **Improved Response Time**: By prioritizing shorter commands, SPN reduces the average response time, benefiting user experience in interactive environments.
- **Adaptability**: Aging allows the system to refine runtime estimates based on recent process behavior, improving the accuracy of scheduling decisions over time.

### Disadvantages of SPN with Aging in Interactive Systems
- **Risk of Starvation**: Longer commands may experience delays if shorter commands continually arrive, causing potential starvation for these commands.
- **Challenges in Accurate Estimation**: Although aging helps refine estimates, interactive commands vary unpredictably, so estimation errors can still occur.
- **Inconsistent User Experience**: Users with longer commands might experience lag or delays, which could impact the consistency of responsiveness in interactive systems.

### Differences versus [[Shortest Job First (SJF)]]
- SJF assumes it knows exact runtime of next job, whereas SJN estimates it
- SJN dynamically adapts estimated runtime using aging techniques, as compared to fixed estimates in SJF
