>Assumes runtimes are known in advance. Scheduler always choose job with shortest remaining run time next. If new job arrives with lesser runtime than the current job's remaining time, current process is suspended and new job is started. 

## Properties
- Preemptive

## Advantages
- **Efficient Average Waiting Time**: Like SJF, SRTF minimizes waiting time by focusing on jobs with the shortest remaining time, making it optimal for minimizing average waiting times.
- **Preemptive**: SRTF can switch to shorter jobs as they arrive, which makes it responsive to incoming short tasks and better suited to systems with variable task lengths.

## Disadvantages
- **Higher Overhead**: Because itâ€™s preemptive, SRTF requires more context switching, which adds overhead, especially if many short jobs keep arriving.
- **Starvation of Long Jobs**: Long jobs are more likely to be starved, as shorter jobs continually preempt them.
- **Complex to Implement**: SRTF needs accurate information about remaining job lengths, which is challenging to obtain and manage in real-time.
