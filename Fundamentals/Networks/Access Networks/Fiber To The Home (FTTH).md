### Competing Technologies
- **Direct Fiber:** One fiber leaving central office for each home
#### Active optical networks (AONs):
- Essentially switches ethernet
#### Passive Optical Networks (PONs): 
- Each home has optical network terminator (ONT) which is connected by dedicated optical fiber to neighborhood splitter
- Splitter combines homes (<100) onto a single shared optical fiber connecting to optical line terminator (OLT)
- OLT converts between optical and electrical signals and connects to internet via a telco router
- for PONs, all packets sent from OLT to splitter are replicated at the splitter

### Speeds
