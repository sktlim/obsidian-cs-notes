### Guided Media
#### Twisted Pair Copper Wire
- Consists of 2 insulated copper wires arranged in regular spiral pattern; Twisted to reduce electrical interference from similar pairs close by
- Used by telephone networks
- Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) commonly used for networks within building (LANs)
- Data rates range from 10Mbps - 10Gbps (cat 6a)

#### Coaxial cable
- Consists of two copper conductors, but conductors are concentric rather than parallel 
- Common in cable TV
- Data rates at tens of Mbps

#### Fiber Optics
- Thin medium conducting pulses of light
- Data rates up to tens or hundreds of Gbps
- Immune to electromagnetic interference
- Very low signal attenuation up to 100km
- Hard to tap
- The Optical Carrier (OC) standard link speeds range from 51.8 Mbps to 39.8 Gbps; these specifications are often referred to as OC-n, where the link speed equals n âˆž 51.8 Mbps
### Unguided Media
#### Terrestrial radio channels
- Signals in EM spectrum
- Environmental considerations determine path loss and shadow fading (decrease signal strength as signal travels over a distance and around/ through obstructing objects), multipath fading (signal reflection off of interfering objects), interference (other transmissions and EM signals)

#### Satellite Radio Channels
- Communication satellite links ground stations together
- Satellite receives transmissions on 1 frequency band, regenerates signal using repeater, and transmits signal on another frequency
