## Internals
### Flash Translation Layer (FTL)
#### Responsibilities
- **Logical-to-Physical Address Mapping**
    - Translates logical addresses (used by the operating system) to physical addresses (actual locations in flash memory).
    - Ensures that the operating system can treat the SSD like a traditional hard drive, even though flash memory requires more complex handling.
- **Wear Leveling**
    - Flash memory cells have a limited number of program/erase (P/E) cycles.
    - The FTL distributes writes evenly across memory cells to prevent premature wear of certain blocks and extend the overall lifespan of the SSD.
- **Garbage Collection**
    - Reclaims space by consolidating valid data from partially used blocks into new blocks and erasing the old ones.
    - Frees up blocks for future writes and mitigates fragmentation caused by the nature of flash memory.
- **Handling Erase-Before-Write**
    - Flash memory cells cannot be directly overwritten; they must first be erased before being written.
    - The FTL manages this process efficiently by:
        - Writing to new locations instead of erasing in-place.
        - Scheduling block erases during idle times or as part of garbage collection.
- **Bad Block Management**
    - Detects and tracks bad blocks that cannot reliably store data due to wear or defects.
    - Ensures data is written to healthy blocks, maintaining the integrity of the stored data.
- **Write Amplification Mitigation**
    - Write amplification occurs when more data is written to the physical memory than requested by the operating system.
    - The FTL employs strategies like wear leveling, garbage collection, and buffering to minimize write amplification and improve performance.
- **TRIM Command Support**
    - Works with the operating system to handle TRIM commands, which inform the SSD about blocks of data that are no longer in use.
    - Helps the FTL optimize garbage collection and reclaim unused space more efficiently.
- **Error Correction and Data Integrity**
    - Works alongside the SSDâ€™s error correction algorithms to detect and recover from data corruption during read or write operations.
    - Ensures data reliability even as the flash memory wears out.
- **Caching**
    - Uses onboard DRAM or SLC (Single-Level Cell) cache to temporarily store data for faster access and reduced latency during writes.
