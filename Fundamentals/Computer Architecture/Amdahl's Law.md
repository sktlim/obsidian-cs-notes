Amdahl's Law :: Performance gain from using faster mode of execution is limited by <u>fraction of the time that the faster mode can be used </u>
<!--SR:!2024-10-14,1,230-->

Fraction$_{enhanced}$ is fraction of computation time in original computer than can be converted to take advantage of improvement

Important corollary: If enhancement is only usable for for a fraction of the task, we can't speed up task by more than reciprocal of 1 of that function
