## Introduction
To achieve unlimited amounts of fast memory, an economical solution is using **memory hierarchy** and take advantage of temporal and spatial locality in memory access. 

Memory hierarchy means to organize memory types into levels based on how fast, small, and expensive per byte is. Lower levels are farther from the processor (so the disk/ RAM is lowest level) and the lowest levels adhere by the **inclusion property**.

**Inclusion Property**: Data contained in lower level are a superset of a higher level
