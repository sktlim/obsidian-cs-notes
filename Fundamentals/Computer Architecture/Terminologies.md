**Data path**: component of CPU that performs arithmetic operations; collection of ALUs or multipliers

**Control**: component of CPU that commands data path, memory, and IO devices

**Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)**: Memory built as an IC. Provides random access to any location within 50ns 

**Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)**: Faster but less dense version of DRAM

**Cache memory:** Made with SRAM and acts as a buffer for slower, larger memory

**Volatile memory:** Storage that retains data only if its receiving power as opposed to non-volatile memory that retains data even if its not receiving power

**Response time/ Execution time:** Time to execute task end to end

**Throughput/ Bandwidth:** number of tasks completed per unit time

**Clock cycles per instruction (CPI):** Average number of clock cycles per instruction

**Instruction count:** Number of instructions executed by program

**Pseudo-instruction:** Variation of ASM often treated as an instruction by itself

**Linker:** Systems program that combines independently assembled machine language programs and resolves all undefined labels into an executable; for avoiding recompiling every single file and only recompile the ones that have changes

**Loader:** Reads executable file header $\rightarrow$ Creates address space large enough for file and data $\rightarrow$ copies instructions and data from executable into memory $\rightarrow$ initialize registers and set stack point to first free location $\rightarrow$ jumps to start up routine and calls main routine of program

**Dynamically linked libraries (DLLs):** Library routines linked to a program during execution
